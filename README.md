## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop a stroke prediction model based on various demographic, lifestyle, and health-related features of individuals. The model aims to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke, which can help in early detection and preventive measures.

## Data

- The project utilizes a dataset obtained from the Kaggle competition "Playground Series - Stroke Prediction" (provided in the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files).
- The dataset contains information about individuals' age, gender, work type, smoking status, residence type, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), and other factors.
- Prior to model training, the dataset was divided into a training set and a test set using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- The data was analyzed to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between variables.
- Visualizations such as bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps were created using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
- Key observations and patterns in the data were identified, including the distribution of stroke cases across different categorical variables and the correlation between numerical features.

## Data Preprocessing

- Label encoding and one-hot encoding techniques were applied to handle categorical variables such as gender, work type, smoking status, ever married, and residence type.
- Numerical features were standardized using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn to ensure they have similar scales.
- Missing values were not present in the given dataset, but appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation) could be applied if missing data were encountered.

## Model Training

- Multiple machine learning models were utilized to build the stroke prediction model.
- The models used include Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines.
- The models were trained using the training dataset and evaluated using various performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC score.

## Ensemble Model

- An ensemble model was created to combine the predictions of multiple individual models.
- The individual models used in the ensemble were Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
- The ensemble technique involved training the individual models on a portion of the training data and using the predictions from these models as inputs to a logistic regression model, which learned to combine the predictions effectively.

## Prediction

- The trained ensemble model was used to make predictions on the test dataset.
- The test dataset was preprocessed in the same way as the training dataset (e.g., encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features).
- The final predictions were obtained by applying the ensemble model to the preprocessed test data.
- The predictions were stored in the "submission.csv" file, which contains the stroke predictions for each individual in the test dataset.

## Conclusion

- The stroke prediction model achieved satisfactory performance on the test dataset, as evidenced by the evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC score).
- The model can be utilized to identify individuals who are at a higher risk of having a stroke, allowing for timely intervention and preventive measures.
- Further improvements can be made by incorporating more sophisticated feature engineering techniques, exploring different ensemble methods, and obtaining a larger and more diverse dataset for training.
